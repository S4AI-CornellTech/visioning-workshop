# SIGARCH Visioning Workshop on Sustainable Computing

## Description
As computing permeates every aspect of modern life—spanning data centers, mobile, and emerging technologies like AI and AR/VR—its environmental impact has surged. Computing now accounts for up to 4% of global energy and carbon emissions, rivaling the aviation industry. With demand for computing continuing to grow, energy consumption, resource extraction, and e-waste will escalate, amplifying sustainability challenges across the computing stack.

Beyond energy and carbon emissions, computing’s footprint extends to water-intensive semiconductor fabrication, rare metal extraction, and the mounting issue of electronic waste. Moreover, carbon emissions are shifting from operational energy consumption to hardware manufacturing, driven by efficiency optimizations and increasing fabrication complexity. Sustainable computing demands holistic solutions—optimizing across hardware life cycles, system design, and energy sources—to mitigate its environmental toll while meeting future computational needs.
